# memory-management
Memory Management project in my CECS 325 Systems Programming class

The Memory Management project, for CECS 325-02 System Programming with C++, involves creating a Memory Manager that dynamically allocates and releases memory while tracking available and used memory. We are required to manage allocations and deallocations efficiently, with a starting free memory pool of 64K. The project also focuses on handling memory efficiently without the need for re-allocating deallocated memory.
